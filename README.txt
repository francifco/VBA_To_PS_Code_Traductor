That is a translator of Visual Basic to PowerShell syntax. This was develop with Flex and bison 2 years ago. For execute this, you need MinGW and download all packages.

How found this?

You write in the file "INba.bas" (VisualBasic) and execute "Ejecutable.exe". The out file will be: "OUTpas.pas1" (PowerShell).
